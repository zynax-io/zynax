## What is Zynax?

> Zynax is to AI workflows what Kubernetes is to containers — a control plane
> that abstracts the execution layer behind a declarative, versionable API.

Zynax lets you define AI agent workflows as YAML manifests and execute them
on any workflow engine (Temporal, LangGraph, Argo) without changing your
workflow definition.

```yaml
# code-review.yaml
kind: Workflow
apiVersion: zynax.io/v1

metadata:
  name: code-review
  namespace: engineering

spec:
  initial_state: review

  states:
    review:
      actions:
        - capability: request_review
      on:
        - event: review.approved
          goto: merge
        - event: review.changes_requested
          goto: fix

    fix:
      on:
        - event: push
          goto: review

    merge:
      actions:
        - capability: merge_pr
      on:
        - event: merge.success
          goto: done

    done:
      type: terminal
```

```bash
zynax apply code-review.yaml
```

## Key Principles

**Declarative-first** — workflows are YAML manifests, not code. Versionable, diffable, GitOps-ready.

**Engine-agnostic** — Temporal, LangGraph, or Argo are plugins. Swap the engine without changing the workflow.

**Capability routing** — workflows route to capabilities (`summarize`, `run_tests`, `open_mr`), not to named agents. Swap the executor without changing the workflow.

**No SDK required** — any system becomes a capability by implementing the `AgentService` gRPC contract. Wrap HTTP APIs, LLMs, Git providers, CI systems — all as capabilities.

**Event-driven state machines** — not DAGs. Supports loops, human-in-the-loop, long-running workflows, and async events natively.

## Architecture

```
     YAML Manifests (Intent)
              ↓
       API Gateway (Go)
              ↓
     Workflow Compiler (Go)    ← YAML → Canonical IR
              ↓
      Engine Adapter (Go)      ← IR → Temporal / LangGraph / Argo
              ↓
        Task Broker (Go)       ← Capability routing
              ↓
    Execution Adapters Layer   ← LLM / HTTP / Git / CI / LangGraph
              ↓
     Event Bus — NATS (Go)     ← All events
              ↓
    Memory Service (Go)        ← KV + Vector context
```

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design.

## Quickstart

**Prerequisites:** Docker Desktop. Nothing else.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zynax-io/zynax.git
cd zynax
make bootstrap   # one-time: build the zynax-tools Docker image
make dev-up      # start the full local stack
```

### Key make commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `make test` | Full test suite — spec validation + Go unit tests + BDD contracts + Python tests |
| `make test-unit-go` | Go unit tests with coverage report for all services |
| `make test-bdd` | Godog BDD contract tests for all `protos/tests/` packages |
| `make lint` | Proto + Go + Python lint |
| `make audit` | Dependency vulnerability audit — govulncheck (Go) + pip-audit (Python); exits 1 on any finding |
| `make security` | Full security scan — adds bandit SAST to the audit checks |
| `make validate-spec` | Validate all YAML manifests against JSON schemas |
| `make generate-protos` | Regenerate Go + Python stubs from `.proto` files |
| `make build-tools` | Build the `zynax-tools:local` Docker image (run once after clone) |

## Milestone Status

| Milestone | Status | Version | Docs |
|-----------|--------|---------|------|
| **M1 — Contracts Foundation** | **Complete** | v0.1.0 | [Engineering Review](docs/milestones/M1-engineering-review.md) · [Release Notes](docs/milestones/M1-release-notes.md) |
| **M2 — Workflow IR** | **Complete** | v0.1.0 | [Epic #101](https://github.com/zynax-io/zynax/issues/101) |
| M3 — Temporal Execution | Planned | v0.2.0 | — |
| M4 — YAML System + CLI | Planned | v0.3.0 | — |

**M1** delivered the contracts-only foundation: 8 gRPC services defined as protobuf contracts,
AsyncAPI spec covering 11 event channels, generated Go + Python stubs, 140+ BDD contract
test scenarios across all services, and 5 CI gates (proto-breaking, stubs-freshness,
layer-boundaries, conventional-commit, PR-size).

**M2** delivered the Workflow IR compiler — the first running service in the platform:
YAML parser + WorkflowGraph builder, structural and semantic validators (no orphan states,
terminal state required, valid capability refs), WorkflowGraph → WorkflowIR serialisation
(protobuf), gRPC API layer (`CompileWorkflow` / `ValidateManifest` / `GetCompiledWorkflow`),
JSON Schemas for `Workflow`, `AgentDef`, and `Policy` manifest kinds, `make validate-spec`
target, and reference workflow YAML examples. Coverage gate ≥ 90% on all domain packages.
